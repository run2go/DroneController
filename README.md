# DroneController
Object Controller using LSL with RayCasting to determine Target Vectors.
Allows a rotating polygon resting pattern that dynamically adapts to the amount of Drones rezzed in the world.


## Setup
| Step | Description |
| - | - |
| 1 | Upload the two LSL files to SL |
| 2 | Create inworld objects for HUD & Drone |
| 3 | Put the DroneController.lsl in the HUD |
| 4 | Place the Drone.lsl in the Drone object |
| 5 | Copy the Drone object into the HUD |
| 6 | Attach & wear the HUD object |


Create a gesture to toggle on & off the DroneController.
- Add chat entry: `/9871 toggle`
- Keybind: `SHIFT + SPACE`

Add a second gesture to detect an agent/target for the Drones.
- Add chat entry: `/9871 trigger` 
- Keybind: `CTRL + SPACE`

## Usage
Enable the DroneController via your gesture hotkey to boot it up.
Use your camera/mouselook and aim at your desired target, followed by activation of the detect gesture.

The HUD will display the current target position (vector) or object/agent name if possible while in tracking mode.
